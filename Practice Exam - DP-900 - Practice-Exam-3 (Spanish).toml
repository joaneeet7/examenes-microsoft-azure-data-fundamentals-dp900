What feature of SQL Database (based on the SQL Server engine) allows you to prevent sensitive fields (such as social security number, phone number, credit card number) from being displayed in a report by partly hiding the value to provide increased data privacy?
Always On Encryption
Correct answer
Dynamic Data Masking
Azure Data Encryption
Row-level security
Overall explanation
Dynamic data masking (DDM) limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. It can be used to greatly simplify the design and coding of security in your application. Dynamic data masking helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to specify how much sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. DDM can be configured on designated database fields to hide sensitive data in the result sets of queries. With DDM the data in the database is not changed. DDM is easy to use with existing applications, since masking rules are applied in the query results. Many applications can mask sensitive data without modifying existing queries.

By what method can you limit who has access to your Cosmos DB account from the Internet?
Regenerate the primary key
Disable public network access to Cosmos DB
Azure Firewall
Correct answer
IP policy-based access control
Overall explanation
y default, your Azure Cosmos account is accessible from internet, as long as the request is accompanied by a valid authorization token. To configure IP policy-based access control, the user must provide the set of IP addresses or IP address ranges in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) form to be included as the allowed list of client IPs to access a given Azure Cosmos account. Once this configuration is applied, any requests originating from machines outside this allowed list receive 403 (Forbidden) response. Disabling access to the public network may also be effective, but that eliminates access entirely and does not control access to a select group of people.

How do you implement the Zero Trust model of security?
Add Multi-Factor Authentication using Azure AD Conditional Access.
Use Azure's Advanced Threat Protection feature for AI monitoring of activities.
Correct answer
Verify each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network.
Require all users to be registered in Azure Active Directory for access.
Overall explanation
Instead of believing everything behind the corporate firewall is safe, the Zero Trust model assumes breach and verifies each request as though it originated from an uncontrolled network. Regardless of where the request originates or what resource it accesses, the Zero Trust model teaches us to "never trust, always verify." Some of these techniques may contribute to security, but the Zero Trust model is about verification and assuming that your systems have been breached.

Question 40

You company has one SQL Database server that has two SQL Databases on it. The databases are both parts of the same application and anyone who can access one database should also be granted access to the other. How do you configure your firewall to enable this?
Correct answer
Server-level IP firewall
Database-level IP firewall
Azure Firewall service
Network Security Group
Overall explanation
If you need to white-list (or preapprove) a specific Ip address or range to the entire server, a server-level firewall rule should suffice. You could add individual database-level IP firewall rules, but that is not the optimal solution. An NSG cannot help here, and the Azure Firewall service is more complicated to set up.
