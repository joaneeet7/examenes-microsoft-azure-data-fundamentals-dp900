A customer just purchased a service from your company, and a new data row was added to table SALES to indicate this event as soon as it happened. What type of database is this?
Correct answer
Transactional database
Data warehouse
Caching database
Analytics database
Overall explanation
The management of transactional data using computer systems is referred to as online transaction processing (OLTP). OLTP systems record business interactions as they occur in the day-to-day operation of the organization, and support querying of this data to make inferences.

Question 2
Skipped
What is the impact of allocating too many Request Units per second (RU/s) to a Cosmos DB database or container?
Cosmos DB will scale the RU/s to what you use, regardless of what you provision
The provisioned RU/s doesn't impact anything
Queries will scale in performance to the number of RU/s you have allocated
Correct answer
You will have to pay for the amount allocated regardless of how many are used
Overall explanation
The minimum throughput you can allocate to a database or container is 400 RU/s. You can increase and decrease the RU/s for a container at any time. Allocating more RU/s increases the cost. However, once you allocate throughput to a database or container, you'll be charged for the resources provisioned, whether you use them or not.

You have 10 TB of log files stored in an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, and would like to save some money on storage. These files are historical, and you don't expect to be needing to access them any more. Because of company policy, you still need to keep them around for 3 more months in case they are needed. What actions can you take to reduce the cost, in the fewest possible steps?
Set the default access tier on the account to Cool tier
Implement a compression algorithm (like ZIP) to reduce the size of the files
Use Azure Data Factory to move the data from high cost Data Lake storage to lower cost standard Blob Storage
Correct answer
Implement lifecycle management policies on the Azure Data Lake storage to move files to cool or archive storage tier
Overall explanation
Lifecycle management does work on Azure Data Lake storage. You do not need to move the files nor compress them, simply create a rule that sets the files to a lower-access option to save money. Cool tier is probably best, since archive tier has a longer minimum length of time. Setting the default on the account will not change the existing files access tier.

You have a SQL Database Server named SQLDB, and two SQL Databases named DB1 and DB2. SQLDB has a server-level firewall that allows IP addresses in the range 123.123.123.0-123.123.123.255 and denies all other traffic. DB1 has a database level firewall rule that allows IPs in the range 123.123.123.0-123.123.123.10. When a client using the IP address 123.123.123.25 attempts to access DB1, are they successful?
No, the connection will not succeed
Correct answer
Yes, the connection will succeed
Overall explanation
You can have both server- and database-level firewall IP rules, and they exist independently. An IP can exist in a database rule and not a server rule, and the user would have access to the specific database and not all databases on the server. In this case, the client IP falls in the range of the server-based IP rule and would be allowed access to all databases on the server including DB1, despite the client IP not being in the database-level IP rule.

Which of the following can be called semi-structured data?
A printed invoice
Images in a blob storage account
SQL Database table
Correct answer
Data stored in XML format
Overall explanation
Semi-structured data is less organized than structured data, and is not stored in a relational format, as the fields do not neatly fit into tables, rows, and columns. Semi-structured data contains tags that make the organization and hierarchy of the data apparent - for example, key/value pairs. Semi-structured data is also referred to as non-relational or NoSQL data. The expression and structure of the data in this style is defined by a serialization language. XML is an example of semi-structured data. It contains properties and data, but there is nothing that enforces a fixed schema on the contents of the file, and no context of mandatory fields. Yes, XML can refer to a schema, but it doesn't enforce it itself. Refer to Microsoft Doc: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/choose-storage-approach-in-azure/2-classify-data

SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. Any procedure that constructs SQL statements should be reviewed for injection vulnerabilities because SQL Server will execute all syntactically valid queries that it receives. Even parameterized data can be manipulated by a skilled and determined attacker.
